# Discord-Casino-Bot
A "gambling" bot that I made for fun for a Discord server.(outdated)

Obviously, this is not an optimized bot at all. This was my first attemt at creating a bot just to learn how it works and to have some fun. Thus the methods I used are very primitive. All the code is in the "index.js" file, making it very long (1000+ lines) and there are just a bunch of if statements. I am just saving this here for further references and to improve my skills.
